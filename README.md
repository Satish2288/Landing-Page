# Landing-Page
Step 1: Set Up the Basic HTML Structure
Start by creating the basic structure of your landing page with HTML. This should include:
A navigation bar (<nav>) for site navigation links.
A header section (<header>) with a hero image and your hotel's value proposition.
A main content area (<main>) where you will detail your hotel's amenities, services, and special offers.
A footer (<footer>) with additional information like contact details and social media links.

Step 2: Style with CSS
Use CSS to style your landing page. Focus on colors, fonts, margins, padding, and other design elements to make your page visually appealing and aligned with your hotel's brand.
Use a consistent color scheme that reflects your hotel's branding.
Choose readable fonts and establish a clear hierarchy for headings and text.
Utilize margins and padding to create a clean layout with ample white space.
Make sure your design is responsive, looking good on both desktop and mobile devices.

Step 3: Enhance with JavaScript
Use JavaScript to add interactivity to your landing page. For example, you might want to create a dynamic booking form that validates user input or a navigation menu that responds to user actions.

Step 4: Test and Optimize
Before publishing your landing page, test it thoroughly. Ensure that all links work, the layout looks good on all devices, and that the page loads quickly.
Use A/B testing to try out different versions of your landing page and see which performs better
Optimize images and other media to load quickly without sacrificing quality.
